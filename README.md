âš¡ Relationship Types
ğŸŸ¢ One-to-Few (user.js)

Small number of related items (e.g., user with a few addresses or phone numbers).

Uses embedded documents for efficiency.

ğŸŸ¡ One-to-Many (order.js)

Medium number of related items (up to thousands).

Uses ObjectId references for better scalability.

ğŸ”´ One-to-Squillions (post.js)

Very large related datasets (e.g., comments on viral posts).

Uses referencing with pagination, indexing, and separate collections for performance.
